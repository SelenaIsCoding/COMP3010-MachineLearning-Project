## Hanchu Zhang

### Background
Background: A company specializing in Big Data and Data Science is looking to recruit data scientists who have
successfully completed their training courses. Numerous individuals have signed up for the training. The company aims to
identify candidates genuinely interested in joining the company post-training, as opposed to those seeking new
employment opportunities. This distinction is crucial for reducing recruitment costs and time, improving training
quality, as well as planning course structures and categorizing candidates. Demographic, educational, and experiential
information related to candidate sign-ups and enrollments is available. The dataset is designed to understand the
factors leading individuals to leave their current jobs.

Problem Statement:
Predict the probability of a candidate will work for the company
Interpret model(s) such a way that illustrate which features affect candidate decision
